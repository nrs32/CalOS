How many bytes of RAM does the virtual machine have by default?
---> 1024 words, but word size is not defined

What are the registers that the virtual machine has?
---> reg0, reg1, reg2, pc

What arguments does the instruction JLZ take and what does the instruction do?
---> jump less than zero: takes a register and destination addr to jump to if the register is < 0

When does the CPU check if an interrupt has occurred?
---> After parsing the instruction following every DELAY_BETWEEN_INSTRUCTIONS time interval

What does the Monitor instruction S do?
---> Displays the memory from the starting to ending addr provided

What does the Monitor instruction ! do?
---> Toggles debugging on or off

Can assembly language files contain comments? How about blank lines?
---> Both comments and blank lines are allowed, comments are denoted with #

What function is called to write bytes into memory?
---> _poke_ram which checks for a valid addr in memory and then checks for valid user input before saving bytes into memory.

Do assembly language programs assume they are loaded into memory at certain locations?
---> Yes, fib is loaded in at location 100, and mult is loaded in at location 20.
